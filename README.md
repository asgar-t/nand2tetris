# nand2tetris

This repo holds my HDL and C code for the first 6 projects of the Nand2tetris online course (https://www.nand2tetris.org/)

Main topics covered:
Gate level Design, Combinational Circuits
Digital Logic Devices (Mux, Dmux, Flipflop)
Sequential Circuits
Computer Architecture:
  ALU
  Memory
  Counters
  Registers
Instruction Set Architecture
Assembly Language/Assembler

Hardware Designs: Use the Nand2Tetris Hardware Simulator to load and test .hdl files.
Assembler: Run the assembler script in your preferred programming environment to translate .asm files into binary.
