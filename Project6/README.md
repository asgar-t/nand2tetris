This project's goal was to create an assembler that turns assembly code into machine language
for this CPU, that means a 16 bit string of 1's and 0's. While this is not a real binary file, it 
can be thought of as a "psuedo-binary file."


This project gave me experience with data structures, file handling, text parsing, organization of a large project
and more.
